		<H2 class="H2">How to help:</H2>
		<P><span class="bodytext">Below are a number of suggestions about what to do for a distressed
person for whom you are concerned - or if such a person comes to you. 
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Take the person aside and talk to him / her in private.</B> Try to give the other person your
undivided attention. Just a few minutes of listening might enable him or her to make a 
decision about what to do.  
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Listen carefully and with sensitivity.</B>  Listen in an open minded and nonjudgmental way.
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Be honest and direct, but nonjudgmental.</B> Share what you have observed and why it
concerns you. For example: "I've noticed that you've been missing class a lot lately and 
you aren't answering your phone or text messages like you used to. I'm worried about you."  
 </span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Note that distress often comes from conflicting feelings or demands.</B> Acknowledge this,
and from time to time, paraphrase what the other person is saying. For example: "It 
sounds like on the one hand, you very much want to please your family but on the other 
hand, you aren't sure that what they want for you is what you really want to do."  
 </span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Make a referral.</B>  Direct the person to the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC). Encourage him or her to call and make an appointment right then and there. Even better yet: offer to accompany him or her to CMHC.
 </span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Follow up. </B> Let the person know that you'll be checking back with him or her later to see
how things turned out.  
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Responding in a caring way</B> to a person in distress can help prevent the distressed
person's situation from escalating into a crisis.  
</span></P>



		<P><span class="bodytext">Supporting a friend with a mental health concern can be one of the most important parts of their success in dealing with it.  Check out this video that discuss the importance that a friend makes in dealing with mental health issues.</span>

		<H2 class="H2">Crisis</H2>
		<P><span class="bodytext">A crisis is a situation in which a person's coping mechanisms are no longer working. By
definition, it is a highly unpleasant emotional state. The nature of a crisis can be highly 
subjective and personal, and its severity can range from mild to life-threatening. But 
regardless of its nature, a crisis should always be taken seriously and responded to as 
swiftly as possible. When a person is in a state of emotional crisis, you might see or hear 
the following: </span></P>

		<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Extreme agitation or panic  </li>
	<li>References to or threats of suicide, or other types of self-harm   </li>
	<li>Threats of assault, both verbal and physical  </li>
	<li>Highly disruptive behavior: physical or verbal hostility; violence; destruction of property </li>
	<li>Inability to communicate (for example, slurred or garbled speech; disjointed thoughts) </li>
	<li>Disorientation; confusion; loss of contact with conventional reality</li>
</span></ul>


		<H2 class="H2">What you should do:</H2>
		<P><span class="bodytext">If someone you know is exhibiting some of the above behaviors-particularly if you believe there exists imminent danger that the person might harm either him/herself or someone else - you should immediately call for assistance (on campus, call UTPD at <a href="tel:1-512-471-4441" class="a_class_tlink" title="Phone">512-471-4441</a>; off campus, call <a href="tel:911" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">911</a>). If you are unsure how to respond to the situation, call the Behavior Concerns Advice Line at <a href="tel:1-512-232-5050" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">512-232-5050</a>.</span>

		<div><A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal" class="a_class_tlink" target="_blank">Behavior Concerns Advice Line</A></div>
		<span class="bodytext"> You should not take it upon yourself to approach someone who is highly agitated or violent or decide by yourself what is in the person's best interests. For your safety - as well as that of others and the person in distress - those decisions should be left to trained professionals.
</span></P>

		<H2 class="H2">Protecting your own safety and wellbeing - Recognizing the limits of what you can and can't do: </H2>
		<P><span class="bodytext">In dealing with a distressed person, your own safety and wellbeing are just as important
as that of the person in distress. Recognizing the limits of what you can and can't do to help someone else is a crucial part of this.  
</span></P>


		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>What you can do: </B>
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Be genuinely concerned and supportive  </li>
	<li>Be honest with yourself about how much time and effort you can afford to spend in helping  </li>
	<li>Be aware of your own needs and seek support for yourself  </li>
	<li>Maintain and respect healthy boundaries  </li>
</span></ul>


		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>What you can't do: </B>
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Control how another person is going to respond to you  </li>
	<li>Decide for another person whether or not s/he wants help or wants to change </li>
</span></ul>


 
<H2 class="H2">A final reminder: </H2>
		<P><span class="bodytext">When responding to a person in need, you don't have to do it all alone! When in doubt
about how to handle a crisis situation, you can always enlist the help of the Behavior Concerns Advice Line (<a href="tel:1-512-232-5050" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">512-232-5050</a>).
