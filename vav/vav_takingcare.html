 <H1 class="H1">Taking Care of Yourself</H1>




        
<P><span class="bodytext">The aftermath of interpersonal violence can be emotional and difficult. There is no right or wrong way to feel. It is important during this time to make space to care for yourself. </span>

<H2 class="H2">Healing and Recovery</H2>
<span class="bodytext">Make a special effort to ensure that whatever you do to take care of yourself is done at your own pace and aligns with your own unique needs. The following list includes suggestions on ways to heal and recover from sexual assault. 

<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Identify people you trust to validate your feelings and affirm your strengths. Friends, family, and counselors can make a big difference in the healing process. </li>
	<BR/><li>Choose when, where, and with whom to talk about the violence, and set limits by only disclosing information that feels safe for you to reveal. </li>
	<BR/><li>Consider speaking with a therapist, counselor, hotline volunteer, or Voices Against Violence (VAV)<A HREF="vav_advocacy.html"   class="a_class_tlink"> advocate.</A> Talking about sexual assault can be difficult at first, but often helps survivors regain control in their lives. Many hotlines and online chat hotlines are available 24 hours a day. </li>

	<BR/><li>Try to maintain a balanced diet and sleep cycle as much as possible; avoid overusing stimulants like caffeine, sugar, and nicotine.

	<BR/><li>Use stress reduction techniques, such as exercise (jogging, aerobics, walking) or meditation. UT Rec Sports offers many services here on campus. Check out their offerings and schedules at <A HREF="http://www.utrecsports.org"   class="a_class_tlink">www.utrecsports.org.</A>  <A HREF="http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/mindbodylab.html"   class="a_class_tlink">The Mind Body Lab</A> located in the Counseling and Mental Health Center on the 5th floor of the SSB.  </li>

	<BR/><li>Take time to discover music, art and/or theatre off-campus. Check local listings on Austin newspaper and event websites. Many events around town are free. </li>
	<BR/><li>Discover your playfulness and creativity. Find time for play or take part in a creative activity like drawing, painting, sculpture, poetry, or picking up an instrument. There are many options to take a low-cost art class in Austin. For example, check out the listings at the <A HREF="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/dougherty-arts-center"   class="a_class_tlink">Doherty Arts Center</A> or<A HREF="http://cie.austin.utexas.edu/informalclasses/"   class="a_class_tlink"> UT Informal Classes.</A></li>
	<BR/><li>Allow yourself "time outs" for relaxation (yoga, massage, music, hot baths, prayer, meditation). Give yourself permission to take quiet moments to reflect, relax, and rejuvenate - especially during times you feel stressed or unsafe. </li>

	<BR/><li>Consider writing or keeping a journal as a way of expressing thoughts and feelings.  There are many free, private online journals and websites with rich writing prompts such as <A HREF="http://www.penzu.com/"   class="a_class_tlink">www.penzu.com/</A> </li>
	<BR/><li>Connect with other survivors online. Some places to start are searching for hashtags on social media sites. You can also try searching for "survivor forum" or "survivor message board." </li>
	<BR/><li>Connect with other survivors in person. Group Therapy can be a place to connect with others who may be able to relate to your experience.

<H2 class="H2">Grounding</H2> 
 
<BR><span class="bodytext">Grounding is a coping strategy that is designed to reconnect you with the present. 
Orienting yourself to the here and now helps reestablish connection to your body 
and regain a sense of personal control. Some grounding techniques use the five 
senses, while others work by redirecting your thoughts. You may find that one type 
works better for you, or all types may be helpful. </span>
 
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Grounding through senses:</B> 
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Run cool or warm water over your hands. </li>
	<li>Pick a color and look for it in your surroundings. </li>
	<li>Listen to a favorite song. </li>
	<li>Tighten and release your muscles from your toes up to your face. </li>
	<li>Carry a small object in your pocket to touch when you feel triggered. </li>
	<li>Eat something slowly and focus on the texture and taste.</li>
	<li>Focus on your breathing, noticing each inhale and exhale.</li>
	<li>Carry a scented product, such as an essential oil, to smell. </li>
	<li>Touch several objects around you and notice their texture. </li>
</ul>
</span>
</span></P>

 
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Grounding through thoughts</B>
<ul><span class="bodytext"
	<li>Imagine yourself somewhere soothing. </li>
	<li>Visualize putting your overwhelming feelings in a box and closing the lid. </li>
	<li>Read something out loud. Or read each letter backward and focus on the letters and not on the meaning of the words. </li>
	<li>Think of favorites. Think of your favorite color, animal, season, foodâ€¦ </li>
	<li>Imagine the faces of people you care about, or look at a photograph. </li>
	<li>Remember the words to an inspiring song, quote, or poem. </li>
	<li>Create a mantra such as: "I can handle this." "I know this will pass." "I am </li>
	<li>stronger than this moment." </li>
</ul></span>
</span></P>

 
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>What if it doesn't seem to work?</B> 
If these don't seem to work, try different techniques and don't give up. Grounding 
takes time and repetition. Practice techniques when you are feeling calm until they 
feel comfortable. Take your time. Notice what works best for you and make a note 
of it. Start grounding as soon as you identify that you are being triggered. For more 
ideas, try searching online for grounding techniques.</span></P>
