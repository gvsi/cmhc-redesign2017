<H1 class="H1">Immediate Medical Options</H1>

<P><span class="bodytext">If you have recently experienced sexual assault, your personal well-being and safety come first. How you are feeling is unique to you; there isn't a right or wrong way to feel. However you are reacting, you deserve support and have options. 
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Even if you do not notice obvious injuries to your body, it is highly recommended that you seek medical care as soon as possible after a sexual assault. You may have internal injuries or be in shock, which might prevent you from fully realizing the extent of any injuries. Immediate medical attention will also provide you with more options to prevent the risk of sexually transmitted infections (STI's) and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext">A survivor can access a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE) with or without police involvement. The exam can only occur within the first 120 hours (five days) after a sexual assault with police involvement and 96 hours (four days) without police involvement. The non-report option preserves the evidence for two years, during which time a survivor can make the decision about whether or not to pursue criminal charges.
</P>
<H2 class="H2"><A HREF=" http://www.safeplace.org"   class="a_class_blink">SafePlace</A> has established a Sexual Assault Forensic Exam (SAFE) program and are offering exams (with or without police reports) at their facility.

<H2 class="H2">Keeping Options Open: Sexual Assault Forensic Exams (SAFE)</H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">You have the right to receive the medical treatment you need. One option is a <B>Sexual Assault Exam</B> (previously referred to as a “rape kit” to collect evidence.  The exam can only occur within the first 120 hours (five days) after a sexual assault with police involvement and 96 hours (four days) without police involvement. <B>You have the right to bring a friend, family member, or sexual assault advocate with you to support you during this time.</B> . The non-report option preserves the evidence for two years, during which time <B>you can make the decision</B> about whether or not to pursue criminal charges.  For more information about the non-report option, please see this pamphlet from the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault about <A HREF="pdf/sexual assault examinations without police involvement (TAASA pamphlet).pdf"   class="a_class_tlink">Sexual Assault Examinations Without Police Involvement.</A>   
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Before the Exam</B> 
<BR><span class="bodytext">In order to preserve as much evidence as possible, it is recommended that you <B>do not clean up, bathe, shower, brush your teeth, or comb your hair before the exam.</B> However, it is important to know that you can still have the exam even if you have done any or all of these things. If you decide to change your clothes, place the clothes that you were wearing at the time of the assault in a paper bag.  
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Before the exam begins, you will be asked to sign a consent form allowing medical evidence to be collected and turned over to law enforcement.  Once the exam begins, a doctor or nurse specifically trained for sexual assault examinations will explain each step of the exam with you. Although it may be difficult to discuss, they will ask you about the assault to determine how to best care for you. If you are female, they will also ask you about your menstrual cycle and current use of contraception.  You have the right to decline any of these questions, take breaks or ask questions about the purpose of each part of the exam.  
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext_orange2">It is your right to stop the exam at any point or to refuse certain parts of the exam.  </span>
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>During the Exam </B>
<BR/><span class="bodytext">Medical personnel will listen to your breathing, press on your abdomen, and examine your torso for general signs of injury. They will then collect evidence, which typically includes wiping a swab over the areas that may have come in contact with your perpetrator, combing for hair samples, and collecting fingernail scrapings and debris. If you are female, the doctor or nurse will perform a pelvic exam. For more information on what to expect from a pelvic exams, please see:  <A HREF="http://www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/hs_annualexam.html"   class="a_class_tlink">www.healthyhorns.utexas.edu/hs_annualexam.html</A> 
</P>
<P><span class="bodytext">The nurse will also give you information on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and pregnancy. Although it is too early to detect STIs from a recent assault, it may be recommended to test for some infections to establish a baseline and medication will be offered may help prevent infection.  For more information about other options for STI testing, please see below.
