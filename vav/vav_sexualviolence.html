 <H1 class="H1">Sexual Violence Defined</H1>


<P><span class="bodytext">Sexual violence is any kind of sexual contact against a person's will and without <A HREF="http://vav_consent.html "   class="a_class_tlink">consent.</A> Sexual violence can happen to anyone, no matter their age, gender-identity, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, class background, religion, or ability.

<P><span class="bodytext">Some commonly heard terms that fall under the umbrella of sexual violence include: 
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li><B>Sexual Assault:</B> Any unwanted sexual contact, including intercourse, touching, or oral sexual stimulation that is performed without consent, often through the use or threat of force. </li>
	<li><B>Rape:</B> Any kind of sexual intercourse (penetration) - vaginal, oral, or anal - that is committed against a person's will or is committed with physical force or the threat of force. Intercourse during which the victim is drunk, unconscious or otherwise considered unable to consent is also rape. Rape is a subcategory of sexual assault. </li>
</ul>


<H2 class="H2">It's not your fault</H2>

<span class="bodytext">Sexual violence, including sexual assault, is a choice one person makes to ignore or deny someone else's wishes and autonomy through violent sexual means. Sexual assault is never the fault of the person experiencing harm, no matter the circumstance or the type of relationship between those involved. A common feeling shared by those who have survived a sexual assault is that they somehow must have been to blame for what happened. If you are having similar thoughts and feelings, it is important to remember that nobody ever asks to be raped or sexually assaulted. You are not to blame, even if you: 
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>had too much to drink. </li>
	<li>used drugs. </li>
	<li>froze in response to what was happening. </li>
	<li>did not fight back. </li>
	<li>have little or no memory of what happened. </li>
	<li>have had sex with this individual or someone else before. </li>
	<li>said "yes" to one type of sexual intimacy but not to what happened. </li>
	<li>were sexually assaulted by someone who: </li>
	<ul type="disc"><BR><span class="bodytext">
	<li>is related to you. </li>
	<li>is popular/influential. </li>
	<li>has the same gender identity as you. </li>
	<li>you know and trust. </li>
	<li>you did not know. </li>
</ul></ul>

<P><span class="bodytext">We know that most sexual assault is perpetrated by people who are known and trusted by a survivor. Sometimes survivors question whether what they've experienced is assault, especially if the person who harmed them was a partner or someone with whom they've had consensual sex.  Some people are sexually assaulted by someone they don't know or don't know well.
<P><span class="bodytext">Survivors' needs often change over time and decision making regarding support, reporting, and healing is an ongoing process. Some decisions are time-sensitive. Some resources, such as on-campus counseling, are available no matter when the assault occurred. Survivors are encouraged to consult with a <A HREF="vav_advocacy.html"   class="a_class_tlink">VAV advocate</A> to make informed choices.  UT supports the right of survivors to choose the options that best meet their needs.  If you are a UT student and would like to know more about your rights and options, including reporting, please see the UT Austin <A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/student-affairs/policies/title-ix "   class="a_class_tlink">Title IX Resource Guide.</A>
