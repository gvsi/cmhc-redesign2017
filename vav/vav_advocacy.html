<H1 class="H1">Exciting News for fall 2016: The VAV Survivor's Emergency Fund will now be sustained by an endowment! </H1>

<P><span class="bodytext">In 2005, Orange Jackets Tappee Project raised and donated $10,000 to support Voices Against Violence.  An endowment was established, and CMHC staff opted to reinvest interest in the last ten years, bringing the total of the original Orange Jackets project to about $20,000.  
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">A group of UT student leaders decided to complete the endowment by raising the remaining funds ($5,324.55) to bring up the principal to $25,000. This endowment will ensure that the VAV Survivor's Emergency Fund will always have guaranteed funds available every year. In conjunction with the continued donations we receive from the VAV Support Campaign, student survivors of interpersonal violence will be able to utilize this important resource.

<H2 class="H2">VAV Survivor's Emergency Fund</H2>
<span class="bodytext">Voices Against Violence (VAV) Survivor's Emergency Fund provides financial assistance to student survivors of sexual violence, relationship violence, and/or stalking, towards the aim of increasing that student's safety, coping, and independence. The fund was started in 2001 and has been supported entirely via individual contributions. Accessing the fund provides two important messages to survivors of interpersonal violence:
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>We believe them.</li>
	<li>No one should have to pay for expenses related to an experience of violence that was not their fault. </li>
</ul>


<P><span class="bodytext">If you or someone you know would like more information about how to access the Fund, please contact the Counseling and Mental Health Center to schedule an appointment with a VAV counselor by calling <a href="tel:1-512-471-3515" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">(512) 471-3515</a>.


<H2 class="H2">Type of Expenses Covered</H2>

<H2 class="H2">Voices Against Violence (VAV) Advocacy </H2>
<span class="bodytext">A VAV Advocacy appointment is a confidential meeting meant to provide a student who has experienced sexual violence, dating or relationship violence and/or stalking with information about their rights and options.  This informational appointment assists survivors in identifying which choices make the most sense for them and are typically thirty minutes long.  All VAV Advocacy appointments are held in the Counseling and Mental Health Center, on the 5th floor of the SSB during business hours (8am-5pm, M-F).  CMHC appointments, including VAV Advocacy, are <A HREF="http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/confidentiality.html"   class="a_class_tlink">confidential</A> and not part of the academic record.  Students seeking VAV advocacy do not need to disclose the details of their experience in order to access support.  
<P><span class="bodytext">Survivors' needs may change over time and decision making is an ongoing process. However, we recognize that some decisions are time-sensitive such as choosing to obtain a <A HREF="vav_medicalattention.html"   class="a_class_tlink">sexual assault exam.</A> Survivors are encouraged to consult with a VAV advocate to make informed choices. VAV believes that no one is at fault for their experience of harm or violence.  We want survivors to be fully informed of their rights and options both on and off campus.  The goal of VAV Advocacy is to empower a survivor to make the choices that work best for them.  There is no expectation that a survivor will choose to report or to seek counseling.  Some survivors may choose to attend multiple advocacy appointments to assess their needs and options, while others may choose to not access any additional options.  VAV supports the right of survivors to make decisions free from judgment.  
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Topics covered in these sessions may include:</B> 
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Medical concerns </li>
	<li><A HREF="vav_reportingoptions.html"   class="a_class_tlink">Reporting</A> options and procedures, both to the University and to law enforcement</li>
	<li>UT administrative options through UT Austin Student Conduct and Academic Integrity </li>
	<li>Legal options, including criminal and civil law (Please note that VAV does not offer legal advice, but we can refer to free legal services for survivors.) </li>
	<li>Obtaining an order of protection </li>
	<li><A HREF="vav_safetyplanning.html"   class="a_class_tlink">Safety planning</A> </li>
	<li>Financial resources, including access to the VAV Survivors Emergency Fund </li>
	<li>Counseling options, both short and long-term, on or off campus</li>
	<li>Accompaniment to appointments on campus, or connecting with an advocate from SafePlace for appointments off-campus</li>
</ul>
