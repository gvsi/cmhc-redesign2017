<H2 class="H2">What can I expect from the University?  </H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">The University of Texas at Austin is dedicated to providing a supportive and understanding  environment as you make decisions about your  immediate health, reporting the incident, and  long-term coping and healing.  As such, the University will endeavor to: 
</P></span> 
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>treat all students with dignity, sensitivity, and professionalism. </li>
	<li>assist students to make informed decisions. </li>
	<li>make every attempt to accommodate your request. </li>
</ul>


<P><span class="bodytext">In the University's efforts to support you through the process, to the extent that it can, 
the University will strive to do the following: 
</P></span>
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>fully answer your questions about policies and what to expect. </li>
	<li>notify you of survivor resources, both on and off campus. </li>
	<li>thoroughly investigate allegations in a timely manner. </li>
</ul>

<P><span class="bodytext">It is important to remember that the University has an obligation to investigate every alleged instance of sexual assault, sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment of which the University is made aware. Because of this obligation, the University may proceed to address the matter with the accused under the University's discipline process, even if a student chooses not to report.

<H2 class="H2">What is Title IX and what does it have to do with interpersonal violence?     </H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">Title IX is a landmark federal civil rights law (1972) that forbids exclusion on the basis of gender from any education program or activity receiving federal financial assistance.  The University of Texas at Austin is committed to maintaining a learning environment that is free from discriminatory conduct based on gender. Title IX includes preventing and responding to issues of sexual discrimination, sexual harassment, and sexual violence.  Title IX does not apply to female students only, male and gender non-conforming students are protected too.
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">Title IX requires that students are protected on campus by having an established procedure for handing reports and taking immediate action once a report is received so that a survivor can continue his or her education.  Students who choose to report an experience of sexual discrimination, harassment or violence are also protected from retaliation both from students and employees of the University.  
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">The University does not discriminate on the basis of sex in its education programs and activities and encourages students and non-students who think that have been subjected to sex discrimination, sexual harassment (including sexual violence), or sexual misconduct by another student, member of the faculty or staff, or campus visitor or contractor are encouraged to report their experience.

<H2 class="H2">How long do I have to report?   </H2>


<span class="bodytext">It's important to remember that waiting to make a report can impact the investigation process and whether a case is able to be successfully prosecuted. 
</P></span>
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>For a report with a Texas police department, survivors of sexual assault have 10 years to report under the Texas criminal statute of limitations laws if there is no DNA evidence. </li>
	<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>If DNA is collected during the investigation, there is no statute of limitations. </li>
	
</ul><BR/>
	<li>For a report to the University, survivors can report an incident of sexual violence at any time. </li>
	<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>However, waiting more than 90 days, or 30 days after the next academic term begins, whichever is longer, to file a report may limit the type of investigation, adjudication, and disciplinary actions available.  For more on the University's sexual harassment and discrimination policy, please see the sections below and Appendix C, Chapter 11 of the General Information Catalog. The appendices to the Catalog are also available online at  <A HREF="http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices"   class="a_class_tlink" target="blank">http://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/appendices</A> </li>

</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">Here are some things to keep in mind:
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Interpersonal violence (sexual violence, relationship violence and stalking) is never the fault of the survivor – start by believing.  </li>
	<li>There is no one way a survivor can or should respond to harassment, assault or abuse.  </li>
	<li>You can ask a survivor if they are interested in learning about resources and options available to them.  It is okay to talk with a survivor about options but important to not force or persuade as this can be disempowering.   </li>
	<li>A survivor has the right to determine if and when to share their story, including formal reporting options to the University and/or to law enforcement.</li>
	<li>However, please keep in mind the mandatory reporting obligations for employees of the University summarized above.  </li>

<H2 class="H2">Reporting to Law Enforcement   </H2>


<span class="bodytext">Regardless of whether or not the alleged respondent was a UT student at the time of the incident, you may choose to file a report with the police. If you decide to move forward with making a report to the police, it is important to note that police jurisdictions depend on where the sexual assault occurred. The decision to engage in the criminal legal system can be a difficult one. Voices Against Violence (VAV) can assist you with knowledge about what this decision entails through an Advocacy Appointment. 
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">If the alleged incident occurred on the UT campus, a report may be filed with the  UT Police Department (UTPD) by calling <a href="tel:1-512-471-4441" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">512.471.4441</a> or visiting UTPD headquarters at 2201 Robert Dedman Drive (across from the Manor Garage and the football stadium). 
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">If the alleged incident occurred in Austin but off campus, a report can be filed with the Austin Police Department (APD) by dialing 911, regardless of how long ago the assault happened. Upon calling, a uniformed officer will be dispatched to your location to take the written report. 
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">If the alleged incident occurred in another city, the local police department that has jurisdiction over that area will need to be contacted. Call 911 for assistance and you will be directed to the correct police department. 
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">Under Texas law, a claimant in a sexual assault case has control over: 
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>having a <A HREF="vav_medicalattention.html"   class="a_class_tlink">Sexual Assault Exam</A> to preserve evidence with or without a police report </li>

<P><span class="bodytext">Once a report is made to Student Judicial Services, an investigation will be launched with two staff member team.  The investigation process and findings must be completed with 60 days under federal law once a report has been made.

<P><span class="bodytext">Student Judicial Services may, at your request, take steps to protect your emotional health and physical safety.  For example, you may be allowed to drop a class or, if you live on campus, you may be allowed to move to another campus living environment.  Such arrangements will be facilitated through the Office of the Dean of Students. If there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the respondent presents a continuing danger to people or property or poses an ongoing threat of disrupting the academic process, the Office of the Dean of Students may take interim disciplinary action against the respondent as appropriate. 
</P></span>
<P><span class="bodytext">It is important to remember that the University has an obligation to investigate every alleged instance of sexual assault, sexual misconduct, and sexual harassment of which the University is made aware. Because of this obligation, the University may proceed to address the matter with the accused student under the University's discipline process, even if you choose not to file a complaint with SJS.

cooperation with law enforcement, as the final decision regarding prosecution rests 
with the District Attorney. Another option you may pursue is a civil lawsuit. In civil 
lawsuits, an alleged respondent could be ordered to pay money to compensate a 
claimant for physical and/or emotional damages. In limited situations, a claimant 
may also be able to hold a third party responsible. You may want to consult with a 
civil attorney to explore your options.
