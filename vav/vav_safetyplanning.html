<H2 class="H2">An Overview of Safety Planning</H2>

<span class="bodytext">Safety planning is a tool for thinking through your options for increasing safety and 
security. A good way to begin is by looking at your life, including your schedule and 
home security, to identify areas in which you may feel vulnerable. 

<P><span class="bodytext">Once you identify areas of concern, you can establish specific ways to increase your safety. For 
example, you might: 
 
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>vary your route to and from school, work, and home. </li>
	<li>create a code word for emergencies with trusted friends and family members. </li>
	<li>notify people you know about where you are going and who is going with you. </li>
	<li>alert building security where you live or work about safety concerns. </li>
</ul>

 
<P><span class="bodytext">A safety plan will look different for every individual. No two situations are alike, and 
a response to one may not work in another. It is important to know various options 
for increasing safety. The most important part of a safety plan is that it is tailored to 
your own emotional and physical needs. Working with a VAV Counselor can help 
you access resources on and off campus and think through your best options to 
increase your safety on campus and at home. 

<P><span class="bodytext">If you would like more information on VAV Safety Planning and other <a href="vav_advocacy.html"  class="a_class_tlink">advocacy</A> 
services, please call the Counseling and Mental Health Center at <a href="tel:1-512-471-3515" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">512.471.3515</a>. 
When you call, ask for a VAV appointment.

<H2 class="H2">Safety and Technology </H2>

<span class="bodytext">Computer use can be monitored, and it is impossible to completely clear the web pages you have visited. If you are afraid your internet or computer usage might be monitored, please use a safer computer to access this information, such as a public computer at a library. Also consider creating new e-mail accounts and social media profiles and changing your passwords for current log-ins. 

<P><span class="bodytext">If you have secure access to the internet you may also consider using this online interactive safety planning tool provided by Love is Respect:

<H2 class="H2">Safety at Home</H2>

<span class="bodytext">If you have concerns about your safety at home, there are extra measures you can 
take to increase safety: 
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>If you are afraid, call 911. </li>
	<li>Change door locks and use extra window locks. </li>
	<li>Make a plan with roommates of what you would do if one of you felt in danger.  </li>
	<li>Let neighbors know to keep an eye out and warn you of unusual activity. </li>
	<li>Make apartment or housing security aware of safety concerns. </li>
	<li>Have a police officer review safety in your home. Call the Austin Police Department (APD) at <a href="tel:1-512-974-5000" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">512.974.5000</a> and ask for the District Representative  with the program to request a "home security survey." </li>
 
</ul>

<H2 class="H2">Safety in Public </H2>

<span class="bodytext">If you are concerned about your safety on your way to school or work, you may want 
to use these risk-reduction tips: 
<ul>
	<li>Make a plan: think about what you would do if something happened in public. You may want to consider taking a RAD Self Defense course offered for free by the UTPD. </li>
	<li>Travel in groups or with a friend. </li>
	<li>Let friends/roommates know where you are. </li>
	<li>Vary your routine to and from campus, work, and home. </li>
	<li>If you have a smart-phone, you may want to consider downloading an app to keep you connected to loved ones when going out. Some apps make it possible to discreetly update a network of friends and family on your status and location with only a few strokes of the screen. </li>
 
</ul>

<H2 class="H2">Threats, Harassment, and Stalking Behaviors</H2> 

<span class="bodytext">Be consistent in your response to perpetrators. Perpetrators are typically 
looking for a reaction from you. Direct response to threats or harassment 
may lead to more contact by a perpetrator and is not recommended. 
Disconnecting a phone or blocking a person can sometimes lead to a 
perpetrator attempting personal contact. 
<ul>
	<li>Keep any and all messages as evidence. </li>
	<li>Keep a log of any contact, including online messaging, text messages, e-mail, phone calls, and in-person contact or attempted contact, such as leaving notes and gifts. </li>
	<li>Make reports to the police. Even if a criminal case doesn't go forward, this documentation can be helpful in the future. </li>
	<li>For more information about stalking behavior, please visit: </li>

<H2 class="H2">Protective Orders</H2> 

<span class="bodytext">An important part of feeling safe again is being free from intimidation, stalking, and 
violence from the accused.   Although a Protective Order cannot guarantee that 
freedom, it does provide you with legal recourse if the accused violates the rules 
issued by the court.   A Protective Order might require the accused to stay away from 
your work and home; specifically restrict them from contacting you, your friends, or 
family; and may also order them to attend counseling. 

<P><span class="bodytext">The most common way to get a Protective Order is at the Travis County Attorney's 
office. Walk-in services are available, and the process is free. You do not need to 
make a police report to apply for or obtain a Protective Order. Please keep in mind 
that waiting longer than 30 days after violence has occurred can lessen the chance of 
successfully obtaining an order. 

<P><span class="bodytext">If you have questions about protective orders or would like more information, you 
can speak with a VAV counselor in an Advocacy Appointment.  

<P><span class="bodytext">For more information on protective orders, please see:
