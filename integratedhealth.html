<P><span class="bodytext">The Integrated Health Program is a collaboration between University Health Services and the Counseling and Mental Health Center at The University of Texas at Austin.  This program brings mental health providers to University Health Services, creating a holistic team approach in the treatment of UHS patients. The Integrated Health Program has also initiated classes, programs, and other interventions available to students through the Counseling and Mental Health Center.

<P><span class="bodytext">The Integrated Health team consists of psychologists, clinical social workers, and psychiatrists. This program uses the concept of mindfulness as the foundation of its approach to health. We emphasize a broad definition of health which views optimal health as the integration of physical, psychological, emotional, relational, and spiritual well being.

<H2 class="H2">Why would my UHS provider refer me to a counselor in Integrated Health Program?   </H2>
<P><img class="img-responsive" src="images/ih_image2.jpg" alt="image of nature" width="234" height="162" border="0">
<P><span class="bodytext">Sometimes behavioral/lifestyle changes or psychological interventions can be quite helpful in addressing the symptoms that prompted you to consult a UHS medical provider. Common referrals to an Integrated Health counselor include: 
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Stress</li>
	<li>Insomnia </li>
	<li>Anxiety</li>
	<li>Fatigue </li>
	<li>Headaches  </li>
	<li>GI distress </li>
	<li>Depression </li>
	<li>Chronic pain </li>
	<li>Relationship problems </li>
	<li>High blood pressure </li>
	<li>Chronic health conditions </li>
	<li>Unexplained physical symptoms </li>
</ul></span></P>




<P><span class="bodytext">These are only some of the reasons why a UHS medical provider might want to include a counselor as part of your treatment team. With the emphasis on an integrated approach to  health, the counselor can assist you in identifying different factors affecting your health.

<H2 class="H2">Mindfulness</H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">Mindfulness is the foundation of the IHP approach to health.  Mindfulness is the practice of paying attention purposefully in the present moment.  By practicing mindfulness, we can begin to see more clearly how the choices we make affect our health and this in turn can promote change.
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Diminished awareness of the present moment severely limits our ability to see the variety of choices that we have in responding to any given situation. Instead, we tend to react automatically and get locked into self-defeating patterns, making change very difficult. Through learning to practice mindfulness, we can empower ourselves to take a more active role in our health and well being. 
</span></P>


<span class="bodytext"><B>Mindfulness has numerous benefits including: </B></span>
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Increased ability to cope with stress</li>
	<li>Improved concentration and creativity</li>
	<li>Greater energy and enthusiasm</li>
	<li>Better work performance</li>
	<li>Improved self esteem</li>
	<li>Reduced symptoms of depression, anxiety, and chronic pain</li>
	<li>Improved immune system </li>
</ul>

<a name="one"></A>
<H2 class="H2">How has Mindfulness been used?</H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">Mindfulness has been used with groups as diverse as corporate employees and leaders; educators; students of all ages, including those in professional schools such as law, medicine, and nursing; attorneys; prison inmates; health care professionals; and Olympic and professional athletes.
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Mindfulness is used as the basis for the Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) programs that were founded in 1979 at UMass Medical Center by Dr. Jon Kabat-Zinn. Since then, numerous hospitals and private practitioners around the world have begun to offer such programs including the UT Integrated Health Program (IHP)&sup1;.
