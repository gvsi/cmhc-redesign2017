<H2 class="H2">A common experience</H2>
<p><span class="bodytext">Movies and TV shows  usually depict college life as an incredibly social time full of friends and  parties. What these popular images often leave out are the periods of  loneliness that many students experience. Loneliness is a painful emotion that  results from feeling disconnected or distant from others. Although this is a  common experience for students, different people will feel lonely for different  reasons and to varying degrees.</p>
<p><span class="bodytext">When you arrive at  school as a freshman having moved away from friends and family, the absence of  these relationships that you have come to rely on for support can leave you  feeling lonely. Later in college, you may feel lonely following the loss of an  important friendship or romantic relationship. Loneliness can result from  feeling socially isolated, but this feeling does not only occur when you are  alone. You can also feel lonely in a lecture hall full of other students. These  are all normal experiences.</p></span>
        <p><span class="H2">Making sense of this  feeling</span></p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">How you interpret  your loneliness can play an important role in intensifying or coping with your  feelings. We are constantly &ldquo;talking&rdquo; to ourselves in our minds. The  thoughts we have about a situation often shape the way we feel about it.  Thinking, &quot;I am the only one who feels like this&quot; or &quot;I am weird for feeling  this way when I should be having fun&quot;&nbsp;can make you feel more isolated and  less likely to make attempts to engage socially. On the other hand, reminding  yourself, &quot;This is hard, but everyone feels like this at times&quot; may help you to  cope with your feelings and take action to improve your situation by reaching  out to others. &nbsp;<br>
  <span class="H2"><br>
  Taking action</span></p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Just because feeling  lonely is a normal and common experience for students does not mean there is  nothing that you can do to cope with and reduce these feelings. However, keep  in mind that going into overdrive--joining every possible team, club, and group  in order to avoid ever being alone--can backfire if the result is a myriad of  acquaintances but little time for developing close relationships.</p>
        <p><span class="bodytext">Look over the following ideas and  think about which of these suggestions may be of benefit to you. </p>
        <span class="bodytext">
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Recognize and express your loneliness. </strong>Just admitting your feelings to yourself rather than denying or running away from them can bring some relief. Expressing the way you feel in a journal, to a family member, a friend from home, or a counselor can also be helpful.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Change up your routines. </strong>Sometimes making new connections begins with a simple change: sitting in a new place in class, eating somewhere different for lunch, or studying in a common space instead of in your room. Be open to meeting the people around you.</li>
</ul>

<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Be active. &nbsp;</strong>Exercise improves your mood and can increase your self-confidence. It can also be a great way to meet people. UT&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.utrecsports.org/" target="blank" class="a_class_tlink">Division of Recreational Sports</a> organizes exercise classes, intramural tournaments, and outdoor excursions to do things like camp and canoe. You don&rsquo;t have to know anyone to join a team or trip, and either can make for a fun adventure.</li>
</ul>


<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Be approachable. </strong>People are drawn to individuals who are friendly. &nbsp;Small gestures like smiling at people, saying hello, or keeping the door open when you are in your dorm room can send the message that you are interested in meeting people.</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Nurture your relationships. </strong>In the busy world of college, it is easy to grow apart from friends and family who are not nearby if you don&rsquo;t make time to reach out. If you find yourself missing someone, take a moment to give this person a call. &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<ul type="disc">
  <li><strong>Seek support. </strong>If your feelings of loneliness have become chronic, lasting more than a few weeks or months, talking to a counselor about what you are experiencing may help. Contact CMHC at <a href="tel:1-512-471-3515" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">(512) 471-3515</a> to schedule an appointment or, for more information on what&rsquo;s available, click the links below:<strong></strong></li>
