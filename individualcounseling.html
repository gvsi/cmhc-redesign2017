<P><span class="bodytext">College life can be challenging and is often stressful. Students experience those challenges in a number of different ways: difficulties adjusting to college, confusion in deciding on a major or career path, or struggles in relationships, or making friends or getting along with a roommate. Many students feel anxious, depressed, confused, or overwhelmed at some point during their college experience and need help dealing with feelings and problems that seem beyond their control.  
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">For college students, that help may come from friends, family members, significant others, etc., but in some cases, help is needed from a trained professional. Counseling is a process that can help people identify more effective strategies both to cope with difficult situations and to achieve their goals. While some people who seek counseling have chronic emotional difficulties, most are dealing with normal life events and are simply in need of an objective listener - someone who doesn't judge and who can help them see new alternatives. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Individual counseling is basically a collaborative effort between you and your counselor. Our goal is to provide an open, supportive, and confidential environment for you to address the issues that are concerning you. To make an appointment or learn about our services, simply call our office at <a href="tel:1-512-471-3515" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm"> (512) 471-3515</A> or come by CMHC Monday through Friday  between 8am and 5pm.

	<li>Bereavement and grief related to the loss of a loved one (such as relationship breakups, deaths, parental divorce, or other major losses)</li>
	<li>Questions/confusion about identity, self-image, sexuality, gender, or religious concerns</li>

</span></ul>

<H2 class="H2">When to Seek Counseling</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">Our counselors are trained to intervene or provide support for a countless number of issues, far too many to list in any comprehensive way.  While counseling might be helpful in numerous situations, there are some conditions in which we would strongly encourage you to seek counseling services:  
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>You are unhappy on most days or feel a sense of hopelessness</li>
	<li>You worry excessively or are constantly on edge</li>
	<li>You are unable to concentrate on your schoolwork or other activities</li>
	<li>You are unable to sleep at night or constantly feel tired</li>
	<li>You have experienced a change in your appetite or your weight</li>
	<li>You have experienced a loss (e.g., a relationship breakup, a parent's death)</li>
	<li>You have increased your use of alcohol or other drugs (including cigarettes)</li>
	<li>You feel overwhelmed by what is going on in your life</li>
	<li>You are having thoughts about hurting yourself or someone else</li>
</span></ul>

<H2 class="H2">How Does Counseling at CMHC Work?</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>ELIGIBILITY.</B><BR> Any currently enrolled UT student is eligible to receive our services. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>COUNSELING SERVICES</B><BR>Our individual counseling services include single sessions and short-term counseling. Single sessions are a great service if you have a specific concern or issue that you would like to focus on that can be addressed in one session (e.g., stress management, roommate or interpersonal conflicts). 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Short term counseling is weekly for a specified period of time. Short term counseling is a service for concerns or issues that are more involved and beyond what a single session can provide (e.g., anxiety, depression, grief/loss). 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Whether you call or come by CMHC to make an appointment, a BART (Brief Assessment and Referral Team) counselor will meet and/or talk with you, gather some information about you (e.g., name, phone number, whether you have been to CMHC before), briefly assess your needs, and make a treatment recommendation(s) based on their professional opinion and in collaboration with you. This decision is made on a case-by-case basis and is determined by the appropriateness of time-limited treatment for your individual situation, our expertise in treating your particular problem, the availability of staff and other resources, and other factors. Some students are referred to off-campus counselors. Off-campus counselors have more availability and students can be seen more frequently, with more flexibility and longer term. It is a great option for many of our students, and many do use. Also, if you seek services late in the semester, availability of ongoing services may be more limited. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>CMHC COUNSELORS</B><BR> Counseling services are provided by licensed psychologists, social workers, and professional counselors. Services may also be provided by other mental health professionals, some of whom are in training. All professionals-in-training are supervised by licensed staff. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>RECORDS</B><BR> Any information you share during your contacts with CMHC will be treated with the strictest confidentiality as allowed by law. In accordance with ethical and legal standards, this information will not be disclosed to anyone without your written consent, except in very specific circumstances as required by law. 
<DIR></span><A HREF="confidentiality.html" class="a_class_tlink">Confidentiality</A></DIR>  
<P><span class="bodytext">Counseling records are entirely separate from your academic record.
</span></P>

<H2 class="H2">What Happens During a Single Session or First-Time Appointment for Short-term Counseling?</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">If you and a BART counselor determine that a single session or short term individual counseling is the treatment recommendation that best meets your needs, then you will be  offered the first available appointment that matches your schedule. If you have particular counselor preferences, this might increase the time you have to wait for your first appointment. This first appointment will usually be scheduled within a few days to a few weeks. (Please note that if you are in need of immediate help, inform our staff so that we can connect you to the appropriate CMHC resources immediately.) The total time period required   t is approximately 90 minutes, so be sure to keep this in mind when scheduling your appointment. 
<P><span class="bodytext">It is essential that you arrive promptly in order to allow sufficient time to complete the necessary paperwork. If you are more than 15 minutes late, you will be asked to reschedule. The paperwork includes a demographic and clinical history form, treatment agreement, consent to treatment, and a notice of privacy practices. Your counselor will obtain information about your current concerns, relevant history and goals. Your counselor also will review relevant CMHC policies and procedures, such as confidentiality.

<P><span class="bodytext">If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call our office at <a href="tel:1-512-471-3515" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm"> (512) 471-3515</A>. 

<a name="5"></A>
<H2 class="H2">What Happens during Subsequent or Follow-Up Sessions if Participating in Short-Term Counseling at CMHC</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">For subsequent or follow-up sessions, you will meet with your counselor for 45-minutes, weekly for a specified period of time. If you would like additional counseling beyond what CMHC can provide, then we will work with you to find a counselor in the Austin community.
<P><span class="bodytext">Early on, you will work with your counselor to set goals for your counseling sessions. Establishing clear goals will provide direction as well as help you to monitor your progress in counseling. If you have any questions or concerns about the counseling process, don't hesitate to bring these up with your counselor, who will be pleased to discuss them with you. The exact direction of your counseling experience will depend on the issues you bring into counseling, your counselor's perspective, and the goals you set for your work together.

<H2 class="H2">What if I Have to Cancel My Appointment?</H2>

<H2 class="H2">How to Get the Most Out of Your Counseling Experience</H2>

<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Define your goals.</B> Think about what you would like to get out of counseling. It might be helpful to write a list of events, relationship issues, or feelings that you think are contributing to your distress. Take time before each session to consider your expectations for that session. Self-exploration and change involve hard work, and sometimes painful feelings are stirred up in the process of healing. Counselors are trained to pay close attention to these issues and will probably encourage you to discuss these feelings openly. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Be an active participant. </B>This is your counseling experience, so be as active as you can in deciding how to use the time. Be honest with the counselor and give her or him feedback about how you see the sessions progressing.
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Be patient with yourself.</B> Growth takes time, effort, and patience. All of your coping skills, behavior patterns, and self-perceptions have been learned and reinforced over a long period of time, so change can be difficult and slow at times. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Ask questions. </B>Ask questions about the counseling process, any methods used by the counselor, or about any other services at CMHC. Your counselor is there to assist you.
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Follow your counselor's recommendations.</B> Take the time between sessions to complete any activities suggested by your counselor. Counseling is intended to improve your life in the "real world," so making efforts to try out and practice new behaviors, approaches, or ways of thinking could be a crucial element to the success of your counseling experience.
