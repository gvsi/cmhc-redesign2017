From her experiences, she can definitely say that dealing with these is not a sign of weakness, but a sign of strength; there is nothing more powerful than being taking back control of our lives, growing and learning and becoming resilient. Being a peer educator allows her to facilitate those qualities- which she takes very seriously. <BR>
