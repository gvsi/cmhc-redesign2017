<span class="bodytext">For continuity of care, students who attended UT last semester, aren't currently taking classes here, and plan to return next semester may pay the fee for access during the gap semester. Typically, these are students taking a summer semester away from UT to work or study elsewhere.
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Post-Doctoral Fellows and University/Visiting Scholars</B></span><BR/>
<span class="bodytext">Post-docs and visiting scholars who are not officially registered for classes at UT Austin can pay the access fee. Specific documentation from the program with which they are affiliated is required.
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Future Students</B></span><BR/>
<span class="bodytext">Individuals registered at UT for a future semester and not the current one can pay the fee for access during the semester immediately before their first semester at UT.

<P><span class="bodytext_green">The CMHC Service Extension Fee is $25 per semester</span>
