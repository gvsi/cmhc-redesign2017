<B>What services do you offer to students?</B><BR></span>
<span class="bodytext">CMHC helps students with their personal concerns so that they can meet the daily challenges of student life. Staffed by counselors, psychiatrists, and other mental health professionals.  

<P><span class="bodytext">
<B>When might counseling services be needed?</B><BR></span> 
<span class="bodytext">CMHC offers a variety of services for a wide range of student concerns. We especially recommend that you encourage your daughter/son to seek our services if you notice any of the following symptoms, particularly if they occur on a repeated basis within a short period of time (2-3 weeks): 
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>A sudden drop in academic performance, especially for students who generally Pperform well </li>
	<li>Difficulty sleeping or getting out of bed nearly every day</li>
	<li>Feeling sad or appearing tearful nearly every day </li>
	<li>Social isolation or increased lethargy </li>
	<li>Expressions of hopelessness, e.g., "What's the point of trying?"</li>
	<li>Direct or indirect statements about death or suicide, e.g., "What's the point of living?" or "I wish I were dead"</li>
	<li>Avoidance of certain places or situations, or fear of being alone </li>
	<li>Increased irritability or restlessness  </li>
	<li>Paranoid thinking or incoherent speech </li>
</span></ul>
 
<P><span class="bodytext">
<B>How do I refer my daughter/son to your services?</B></span> <BR>
<span class="bodytext">Encourage your daughter/son to call us between 8 am and 4 pm to schedule an appointment. 
<P><A HREF="appointments.html" class="a_class_tlink">Appointments</A>
<P><span class="bodytext">Students who indicate they are in crisis will be seen by a counselor that day. Students may also call our <A HREF="24hourcounseling.html" class="a_class_tlink">CMHC Crisis Line</A> service at <a href="tel:1-512-471-2255" title="Phone" class="a_class_phonesm">512-471-CALL (2255)</a> <I>(UT Students Only)</I> if they are more comfortable talking to a counselor on the phone.  
</span></p>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>What should I do if my daughter/son is reluctant to seek counseling?</B></span> <BR>
<span class="bodytext">While counseling is a personal decision, sometimes it can be helpful to encourage a student to talk to a counselor about his or her concerns. It is important to remember that it's ultimately the student's decision to seek help, but the following strategies might help persuade an ambivalent student to consider counseling:
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Inform your daughter/son that information shared during counseling is confidential to the extent permitted by state law and will not be disclosed without written permission. </li>
	<li>Remind your daughter/son that she or he can meet with a counselor for one session without committing to ongoing counseling. </li>
	<li>Reduce the stigma associated with counseling. Tell your daughter/son that our counseling services are regularly used by many students for a variety of concerns and that utilizing counseling services reflects good use of one's resources. Just as it is common to visit a doctor when one has a medical problem, there should be no shame in meeting with a counselor to discuss a personal issue or concern.  </li>
	<li>Suggest that your daughter/son visit CMHC's website to become familiar with our services. Encourage your daughter/son to try our<a href="http://www.ulifeline.org/self_evaluator" class="a_class_tlink"> Anonymous Self-Assessment</a></li>
</span></ul>


<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Is it possible for the counselor to update me on what my daughter/son talks about in counseling?</B></span> <BR>
<P><span class="bodytext">Not without the student's written consent. Federal and state laws require that counseling conversations and records remain strictly confidential.  
<P><A HREF="confidentiality.html" class="a_class_tlink">Confidentiality</A>
<P><span class="bodytext">Confidentiality also creates a safe environment for students to explore their personal concerns. Hence our staff cannot provide details about the content of counseling or whether a particular student has sought our services without the student's written consent. 

<P><span class="bodytext">Knowing that your son/daughter is in counseling, but not knowing anything about the content of those sessions, can sometimes be challenging for concerned parents.  However, it is important to understand that confidentiality is an essential element of the counseling process, as it creates a safe environment for students to discuss their personal concerns openly and honestly.  
</span></P>

<P><span class="bodytext"><B>What should I do if I am very concerned about my son/daughter's physical or emotional safety?</B></span> <BR>
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext">In an emergency or life-threatening situation, call the University of Texas Police Department at 512-471-4441.  UT Police officers have been specifically trained to deal with the mental health issues faced by University students.  If the student is off-campus, you should instead contact the local police department (e.g., Austin Police Department, 512-974-5000 or dial 911 within city limits).
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext">Another good resource is the University's Behavior Concerns Advice Line
		<P><A HREF="http://www.utexas.edu/safety/bcal/" class="a_class_tlink">Behavior Concerns Advice Line</A>
		<P><span class="bodytext">at 512-232-5050.  One purpose of the BCAL service is to provide a resource for parents who have concerns about the well-being of a student. When you call the BCAL service, you will be able to consult with a trained University staff member who will assist you in identifying appropriate courses of action.
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext">If you know that your son/daughter has sought counseling at CMHC and you have information of an urgent nature that you wish to communicate to his/her counselor, please call CMHC at 512-471-3515 (M-F, 8am to 5pm) and ask to speak to the Assistant Director for Clinical Services.  Alternatively, you may call the CMHC Crisis Line service 24 hours a day at 512-471-CALL (2255) <I>(UT Students Only)</I>.  Please note that we may inform your son/daughter that you have contacted us.
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Will counseling become part of my son's/daughter's academic record? </B></span> <BR>
			<span class="bodytext">No. Our records are confidential and are entirely separate from students' academic records.
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Whom should I contact if I have questions or feedback?</B></span> <BR>
			<span class="bodytext">Please contact us directly at 512-471-3515 if you have questions or feedback about our services.
</span></P>


		<P><span class="bodytext"><B>What should I do if my student is withdrawing from UT?</B><BR>
Reasons for choosing to withdraw from the university are many and varied. To find supportive resources for your student as their going through the process, visit the Dean of Students Website, <A HREF="http://deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/withdrawal.php" class="a_class_tlink"><span class="bodytext_blue">www.deanofstudents.utexas.edu/emergency/withdrawal.php</span></A>  As this website says, we hope the links on this website will help you in identifying campus and community resources that may be helpful during and after your student's withdrawal and upon re-admittance. Please be aware that this is not an exhaustive list, and the community resources listed are not affiliated with The University of Texas at Austin.
