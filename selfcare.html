		<H2 class="H2">What is Self-Care?</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">College can be really exciting, but it can also at times be stressful. Practicing self-care can help you manage the ups and downs of college life. Self-care refers to activities and practices that can help you to reduce your stress and enhance your overall well-being: essentially, proactively taking care of yourself. Self-care is essential in order to be successful inside and outside of the classroom. 
</span></P>

<P><span class="bodytext">Self-care is more than an occasional treat, but a way of living each day that incorporates practices and behaviors that help you feel refreshed, re-energized, and rested. Self-care helps you deal with the daily stresses in your lifeâ€”from academic pressures, to interpersonal relationships, to future plans, and others. Everyone deals with stress differently, and everyone's preference for practicing self-care is different as well. 
</span></P>

<H2 class="H2">Why is Self-Care Important?</H2>

<P><BR><BR><H2 class="H2">How do I make time for self-care?</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">When it feels like your to do list is a mile long, it's easy to feel like you don't have time to practice self-care. Oftentimes we view self-care activities as not being productive, but it's important to shift this way of thinking by broadening what we view as productive. Studies show that if we prioritize taking care of our mind, body and spirit, it will actually help us be more productive academically and professionally in the long run. 


<H2 class="H2">Here are some tips to help prioritize self-care:</H2> 
<P><span class="bodytext">Add it to your calendar or to do list: Block off time in your day to practice self-care. 
<BR/>Add self-care into your day: Find small windows of time to practice self-care. For example, if you arrive to class or a meeting 10 minutes early, how can you use those 10 minutes to practice self-care?
<BR/>Make it a habit: Create a routine so practicing self-care becomes a habit. 
<BR/>Remember that you deserve self-care: People often think that
