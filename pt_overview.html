  <P><span class="bodytext">The Practicum Training Program at the Counseling and Mental Health Center at UT-Austin is designed to provide students in the Counseling and Clinical Psychology doctoral programs and in the Counselor Education master's program with a focused and intensive experience in various clinical modalities, including providing individual psychotherapy, group psychotherapy, and behavioral health interventions to university students.  The Practicum Training Program consists of the Counseling Practicum, the Counselors in Academic Residence Practicum, and the Integrated Health Practicum.

<H2 class="H2">Counseling Practicum</H2>

<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Clinical skills and competency in providing individual and group counseling</li>
	<li>Understanding of and competence in the process level dimension of psychotherapy as well as use of the therapist's self and the therapy relationship as agents of change</li>
	<li>Working competently and compassionately with clients from diverse life backgrounds and with wide-ranging presenting concerns</li>
	<li>Developing skills for working with a multidisciplinary professional staff in a large university counseling center</li>
	<li>Understanding and working with the "Use of Self" model of training at CMHC</li>

</span></ul></P>

 <P><span class="bodytext">All practicum students at CMHC participate in individual therapy training and may have the option of receiving group therapy training. 
</span></P>

<H2 class="H2">Structure of the Counseling Practicum</H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">The practicum at CMHC consists of a combination of time dedicated to direct clinical services, individual and group supervision, participation in a weekly seminar, and additional hours for case management and documentation.  The designated block of direct clinical service time is a minimum of 8 hours per week. Students may choose to emphasize individual counseling and thus dedicate all of their clinical hours to this activity, or they may schedule a lower number of individual counseling hours in order to gain experience in co-leading a group. Students may also increase the number of hours (beyond the 8 hour minimum) in order to incorporate more individual clinical time, or to add a group experience. Including direct clinical services, supervision, seminar, and case management time, the total minimum commitment to the practicum is 13 hours per week. (Please note that the specific structure of the practicum is subject to change) 
</span></P>


<H2 class="H2">Individual Counseling Experience</H2>

<P><span class="bodytext">Each trainee is expected to provide a minimum of six hours per week for individual counseling sessions. Given the variability in attendance rates and the fact that clients may be seen less frequently than every week, the size of trainees' caseloads varies. Practicum students at CMHC have the opportunity to gain experiences working with clients in designated single-session appointments and in brief (2-6 session) therapy.


<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Individual Supervision</B><BR>
<P><span class="bodytext">Each practicum student will receive 1.5 hours per week of one-to-one individual supervision focused on their individual counseling cases. Supervision consists of various elements, including case review and consultation, joint observation of video recorded clinical sessions, exploration of practicum therapists' reactions to clinical relationships, and issues related to professional development. Supervision is tailored to each student's needs.    

<P><span class="bodytext">Supervisory assignments are made at the beginning of each semester by the Practicum Training Director in consultation with CMHC staff members and other mental health professionals, and with trainee input, to help maximize learning and growth and to minimize the impact of dual-role issues. In the Fall semester, each practicum student is supervised by a licensed member (either a licensed professional counselor, a social worker, or a psychologist) of the CMHC staff. During the Spring semester, most practicum students are supervised directly by psychology interns. 
 

<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Group Intervention Experience and Supervision</B><BR>
<P><span class="bodytext">During each semester, trainees may participate as co-leaders of a group experience offered at the CMHC. Interested trainees will be matched with a CMHC staff member, who will serve as the trainee's group supervisor and co-leader. Throughout the practicum, trainees who choose this option will gain experience as a co-leader and will receive one hour of supervision weekly, in addition to the direct supervision provided during group sessions. The group intervention portion of the practicum is optional, and availability to participate may vary, depending on the number of groups offered each semester.
</span></P>

  

<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Practicum Seminar / Group Supervision </B><BR> 
<P><span class="bodytext">Each practicum trainee is expected to attend the seminar every week for the duration of the practicum. The seminar is typically scheduled during Monday afternoons. Practicum students are asked to arrange their course schedule in order to include the seminar. Practicum trainees are able to adjust almost every other aspect of this training experience to fit their academic schedule.   
<P><span class="bodytext">The two-semester seminar provides an opportunity for practicum students to be guided by a senior staff psychologist as they process with, learn from, share with, and teach each other. We will cover a range of clinical and diversity topics, utilize case presentations and consultations, and have guest speakers to introduce and discuss several critical concepts in therapeutic practice. Various collaborative learning methods may be used in the seminar to foster cohesiveness, mutual learning, and respect for diverse theoretical and worldviews.   


<!-- 
<H2 class="H2">Anxiety Disorders Treatment Track</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">This specialized track of the practicum focuses on the evaluation and treatment of anxiety disorders.  A practicum student in this track continues to attend the general practicum seminar, to see individual therapy clients, and to co-lead groups, with the emphasis being on providing services to clients with identified anxiety disorders.  In addition, the practicum student will have the opportunity to be a member of the anxiety treatment team, with weekly meetings on a day and time to be announced, and may participate in a one-hour seminar focused on anxiety treatment.  Typically, a student participates in the Anxiety Track for the Fall semester and then enters the general track in the Spring.  A practicum student in this track is supervised by the agency's Anxiety Disorders Specialist, Diana Damer, Ph.D.

<P><BR><H2 class="H2">Elements Shared by All CMHC Practicum Experiences</H2>



<H2 class="H2">The Use of Self Model</H2>
<span class="bodytext">Regardless of the specific work activity, a primary "thread" running through all our training activities is the skill of "Use of Self" and its variants. For us, this means assisting the trainee in exploring and understanding the qualities and dynamics that he or she brings to each interpersonal encounter and how these facilitate or hinder effective interactions. It also means that the trainee is encouraged to become more attuned to his or her own thoughts and feelings in working with clients, and recognize how this increased self-awareness can be used to better understand client dynamics and develop effective treatment strategies. Because we believe in the working alliance as an indispensable ingredient in any helping relationship, we encourage trainees to recognize, improve, and employ those personal qualities that will assist in forming effective working relationships with clients, peers, center staff, and other members of the university community.  
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Because our training programs are based largely on a relational, use-of-self training model, and because we believe that optimal professional development occurs within the context of self-reflection and personal exploration, our various training activities will, at times, ask trainees to disclose personal information. Our training staff takes very seriously its responsibility to foster and maintain a safe, trusting, and supportive environment that will allow such disclosures to occur in accordance with the goals and objectives of our training model.  

</span></P>


<H2 class="H2">Diversity</H2>
<span class="bodytext">The CMHC staff is strongly committed to addressing the needs of a diverse student population, and our training programs strive to incorporate and highlight issues of difference as a fundamental part of the training experience.   

<P><span class="bodytext">In 1991, CMHC was one of the first university psychotherapy centers to adopt a Statement on Diversity, as we believed that it was important to make a public statement about our values, commitments, and responsibilities in this area. In 2007, this statement was reviewed and revised by our staff in order to reflect the evolution of knowledge that has occurred over the years as well as our staff's ongoing reflection, discussion, and appreciation of these issues. 

</span></P>
<A HREF="diversity.html" class="a_class_tlink">Statement on Diversity</A><BR>

<H2 class="H2">Orientation</H2>
<P><span class="bodytext">Prior to the beginning of the Fall semester, all incoming practicum students take part in a two-day orientation session designed to familiarize students with various aspects of the practicum. The orientation session is held within one week of the beginning of the Fall semester classes. For students who are selected for the IH track, an additional orientation to University Health Services is required,and students selected for the CARE track receive training specific to the CARE program.




<H2 class="H2">Professional Expectations of Trainees</H2>	
<P><span class="bodytext">Trainees are expected to commit to and demonstrate  ethical behavior as defined in the APA Code of Ethics and to become familiar with and observe all CMHC policies and procedures. Trainees are viewed as emerging professionals and are respected for the services and skills that they provide. Accordingly, it is expected that they will conduct themselves in a professional manner. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext"><B>All practicum students will also be expected to:</B>

<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li><B>Provide six to eight hours each week to be used for scheduling individual counseling clients.</B>  During these hours, it is expected that practicum students will be present at the CMHC, UHS or CARE offices even when no clients are scheduled, due to the fact that clients may be scheduled close to the beginning of clinical appointment times. It is expected that practicum students will use unscheduled time to focus on assigned readings, prepare for supervision, review client records, or to perform case management activities (e.g., making referrals, writing progress notes).</li>
<BR>
	<li><B>Video / audio record every client session. </B> Supervisors often view sessions privately and ask the trainee to show an individual counseling session (or specific part of a session) to aid supervision. Digitally recorded material related to clinical work is treated as confidential and trainees are instructed in how to ensure that this material is secured at all times.</li>
<BR>
	<li><B>Be punctual, consistently attend, and actively participate in the practicum seminar.</B> Practicum students are expected to read and be prepared to discuss assigned readings, to be actively involved in group discussions, and to openly discuss and enlist support and assistance with their clinical caseload.</li>
<BR>
	<li><B>Be punctual, consistently attend, and actively participate in supervision.</B>  Students are expected to prepare for supervision on a weekly basis and to initiate and actively engage in discussions which will lead to their professional growth and to receiving the feedback necessary to provide high-quality services to their clients. Trainees are expected to utilize the CMHC resources available to them if their clients experience clinical crises. These resources include individual supervisors, the Practicum Training Director, the daily crisis counseling teams, and the Associate Director for Clinical Services.</li>
<BR>

<H2 class="H2">Evaluation and Feedback</H2>	
<span class="bodytext">Evaluation and feedback is an ongoing process that occurs verbally throughout each semester. At the start of the semester, supervisors and trainees, in consultation with the Practicum Training Director, will identify supervisory and clinical goals. At mid-semester, the Practicum Training Director will meet with the student's supervisor(s) and then individually with the practicum student to discuss the student's progress on goals and to highlight any areas of concern or growth so that trainees can focus their training efforts on these issues. As indicated, feedback is provided to department faculty who coordinate the practicum placements.  
<P><span class="bodytext">A written evaluation process takes place at the end of each academic semester. Supervisors provide a written summary of each student's competencies and progress, while the student completes a written evaluation of their experiences with their supervisors. Each practicum student meets with her/his/hir supervisor at the end of the semester to review and discuss these evaluations.   
<P><span class="bodytext">Copies of written departmental evaluations will be provided to the appropriate Directors of Training at the student's academic department.
