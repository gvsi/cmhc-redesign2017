<P><H2 class="H2">Program Philosophy</H2>
<span class="bodytext">The program's philosophy is based on the belief that awareness of self enhances the ability to work effectively with others. Many of the training activities focus on the development of the professional use of self. 
</span></P>
			<P><span class="bodytext">Professional Use of Self is considered the intentional use of one's knowledge, experience, perceptions, and skills in the therapeutic relationship in order to benefit the client.
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">CMHC recognizes that this can be a challenging process for the trainee, but it seeks individuals who are open to self-exploration as it applies to professional identity development.
</span></P>



<H2 class="H2">Field Placement Description</H2>
<span class="bodytext">The Counseling & Mental Health Center (CMHC) is staffed by social workers, psychologists, psychiatrists, and licensed professional counselors.
</span></P>
			<P><span class="bodytext">Social Work interns receive supervised training in a clinical setting involving individual, group, and couples counseling, intake, and crisis intervention. In addition, interns receive training in Program Development, outreach skills, and various specialized therapeutic skills involving specific populations and treatments.

<H2 class="H2">Unique Aspects of the placement</H2>

<ol type="1"><span class="bodytext">
	<li><B>August Orientation and TrainingTraining.</B> A training and orientation program, which runs from August 1 - August 31 is planned for our social work and psychology interns before the Fall Semester begins. The program is 40 hours per week for the month of August. A variety of presentations, experiential workshops, and other activities are scheduled to help interns prepare for their roles and responsibilities. In addition to the intensive training activities, informal social events are planned so that interns can build group cohesiveness and meet CMHC staff members. </li>
<BR><BR>
	<li><B>Training Hours.</B> When classes begin for the Fall semester, Social Work interns begin their 20 hour per week placement for the Fall semester. The 40 hour per week Spring semester block placement begins in January. </li>
<BR><BR>
	<li><B>Stipend.</B> A small stipend is provided during the orientation training period.</li>
<BR><BR>
	<li><B>Self & Systems Training Model.</B> CMHC's intern training program reflects a belief in a generalist training model which exposes interns to the functions and service delivery areas common to many agency settings, especially university counseling centers.</li>


<P><span class="bodytext">Interns initially participate in defined, core areas. As they gain experience in the common areas and develop a clearer understanding of their own interests, training needs, and goals, an increased flexibility to determine individual training options is provided. 
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">Professional seminars complementing the on-going work experiences are an integral part of the training. Trainees from various mental health disciplines, including social work, psychology, and psychiatry, enrich the program.
</span></P>
<P><span class="bodytext">CMHC is committed to each social work intern's personal and professional development and is sensitive and responsive to individual needs and interests.
</span></P><BR>
<li><B>Intern Supervision.</B> The CMHC staff seeks individuals interested in recognizing their own strengths and integrating personal and professional growth. Training occurs within the context of close supervisory contact with different senior staff members and through participation in various special training and service activities, such as preceptorships and apprenticeships.</li>

</span></ol>



		<H2 class="H2">Diversity</H2>
		<P><span class="bodytext">The CMHC staff is strongly committed to addressing the needs of a diverse student population, and our training programs strive to incorporate and highlight issues of difference as a fundamental part of the training experience.
</span></P>
		<P><span class="bodytext">In 1991, CMHC was one of the first university counseling centers to adopt a Statement on Diversity, as we believed that it was important to make a public statement about our values, commitments, and responsibilities in this area.  In 2007, this statement was reviewed and revised by our staff in order to reflect the evolution of knowledge that has occurred over the years as well as our staff's ongoing reflection, discussion, and appreciation of these issues.
