		<span class="bodytext">The condition called Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder
(ADHD) is characterized by a number of symptoms, such as impaired concentration, poor attention, restlessness, fidgeting, and impulsive behavior. These symptoms could be the result of a variety of factors or disorders. Therefore, it's really important to have a thorough evaluation from a trained professional in order to find out what might be causing your symptoms and how best to address them. </span>
		<H2 class="H2">What is a "thorough evaluation"?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">A thorough evaluation for ADHD will include several steps and may take several hours. Usually, it involves completing psychological tests, filling out some questionnaires, and participating in a comprehensive interview process to get a history of relevant areas in your life and to learn more about your symptoms. In some cases, other people who know you well may be asked for input so that an accurate conclusion may be drawn.</span>

		<H2 class="H2">Should I get this evaluation?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">Good question! If you have a doctor or a therapist who knows you well, you may want to ask that person if he or she believes an assessment is in order. If you are uncertain, specialists at the UT Learning Center will consult with you about the possible benefits and appropriateness of seeking an evaluation. They can help you decide whether or not it would be helpful to you to get a complete evaluation. The UT Learning Center is located in Jester Center, Room A332A. The phone number is 512-471-3614 and the office is open M-F, 9-5.</span>

		<H2 class="H2">What is the cost of an evaluation?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">A comprehensive evaluation can cost several hundred dollars, though there are professionals in the Austin area who may be able to offer a somewhat reduced rate or help you with a payment plan.</span>

		<H2 class="H2">Whom can I contact about getting an evaluation?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">If you know you would like to have a comprehensive evaluation, contact the Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office for information about some of the professionals who conduct these evaluations. The SSD office is located on the 4th floor of the Student Services Building; its phone number is 512-471-6259.</span>

		<H2 class="H2">Do I need an evaluation in order to receive medical treatment from a UHS or Counseling and Mental Health Center physician for ADHD? </H2>
		<span class="bodytext">The physicians at University Health Services (UHS) do not provide medications for ADHD. These medications may be prescribed by the psychiatric staff at the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC); however, specific documentation is needed. The required documentation includes:
			<ol type="1">
				<li>complete documentation of a formal assessment with objective psychological testing for ADD/ADHD within the last three years and </li>
				<li>past records from any doctors who have prescribed this medication for you in the past.</li>
			</ol>
		</span>

		<H2 class="H2">What if I am already on medication and want to transfer my care to a psychiatrist at CMHC?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">You may be able to transfer your care to the Counseling and Mental Health Center (CMHC), but you will need to provide the CMHC psychiatrist with the specific documentation mentioned above. Contact CMHC at 512-471-3515 for more information.</span>

		<H2 class="H2">What about accommodations?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">The Services for Students with Disabilities (SSD) office assists students who qualify by providing appropriate accommodations. A comprehensive assessment completed within the last three years is required in order to be considered for these services.</span>

		<div><A HREF="http://ddce.utexas.edu/disability/adhd-2/" class="a_class_tlink">Documentation that meets SSD documentation guidelines</A></div>

		<H2 class="H2">What else can I do to help myself?</H2>
		<span class="bodytext">There are many useful steps you can take to address the symptoms you think might be related to ADHD. One resource is the UT Learning Center on campus. The staff there works with students to build reading skills, address test-taking problems, develop better study skills/habits, and also provide tutoring services. Many students with ADHD also experience anxiety, depression, or just general life stress as they cope with the challenges they face. The Counseling and Mental Health Center has counselors available to talk with you about these and other concerns that you might have. The Services for Students with Disabilities office also offers skills building workshops for students who have been diagnosed with ADHD.</span>
