<H2 class="H2">Selection Process</H2>


<P><span class="bodytext"><B>Following is a summary of our selection process:</B></span>
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Applications should be received by the deadline of November 2, 2016. Feel free to call or e-mail the Training Director if you have any questions or experience any difficulties with the submission process.</li>

	<li>The selection committee then reviews your materials, and you will be sent an e-mail no later than the end of the day on December 15, 2016 that indicates whether or not you will be offered an interview. In accordance with APPIC policies, we notify all applicants of their interview status if they submitted a complete application. Please contact the Training Director if you have not received an e-mail notification by that time.</li>

	<li>For applicants who are invited to interview, the e-mailed notification contains a link to an online scheduling program that allows you to quickly and easily schedule an interview with us. We try to have a variety of dates and times available, and we will work with you to find a time that fits your schedule.</li>

	<li>Telephone or Skype interviews will be conducted primarily during the first two weeks of January.  These interviews last about an hour and are semi-structured, but we try to keep them as relaxed and informal as possible.  During the interview, we will ask you questions about your interests, background, and experiences, and will provide you with an opportunity to ask questions.</li>

	<li>In late January and early February, the Training Director conducts "follow-up" calls with each of our applicants. This call is NOT another interview (although occasionally we may have a few follow-up questions). Instead, it is an opportunity for you to find out more about Austin and our program, as well as allowing you to address any remaining questions that you might have. Many applicants use these calls to ask questions about living in Austin, such as housing, employment possibilities for partners, school and day care information for children, etc.</li>

	<li>Throughout the process, you are always welcome to contact the Training Director if you have any questions or if you wish to speak to a current intern.</li>
</span></ul>


<P><span class="bodytext"><B>On-Site Visit Policy.</B>  This year, our interviews will be conducted exclusively via telephone or Skype.  We recognize that the internship interviewing process can be a stressful and costly one.  In order to minimize the financial burdens associated with this process, we have chosen not to have on-site interviews. We want to assure you that visiting our center is NOT an expectation. However, if you are interested
in seeing our counseling center in order to assist in your decision-
making process, you are more than welcome to schedule a visit.  

<P><span class="bodytext">To arrange an on-site visit, please contact the Training Director. A typical visit will last approximately two hours and will include a tour of the facility, a meeting with the Training Director, and a meeting with a current intern (depending upon availability). Opportunities to meet with other staff members will be arranged upon request, if possible.

<P><span class="bodytext"><B>APPIC Guidelines.</B> Our selection process follows all guidelines of the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) and participates in the APPIC Match. In particular, this internship site agrees to abide by the APPIC policy that no person at this training facility will solicit, accept or use any ranking-related information from any intern applicant.
