<span class="bodytext">One of the biggest problems related to gambling and other addictions is that the person engaging in the addictive behavior may be the last to realize there is a problem. You may have sought out this website because you wondered about your own gambling or the gambling habits of someone you care about. We're glad that you had the courage to do so, and hope the following information will increase your understanding of this issue.

<H2 class="H2">What is gambling? </H2>


<span class="bodytext">Risking money or valuables in hopes of winning more than you're risking is gambling. Calling it a "friendly bet" or saying "We're just making the game a little more interesting" does not alter the fact that it is still gambling.
<P><span class="bodytext">Gambling can include betting on sporting events, playing on-line or video poker, playing cards, betting on games of skill, buying lottery tickets and many other activities.
<P><span class="bodytext">Some people can gamble occasionally without it affecting their lives seriously, but many can't. A recent study estimates that three quarters of a million young adults in the United States engage in problem gambling. Closer to home, a study by the Texas Council on Problem and Compulsive Gambling found that teenagers and young adults are at much greater risk for developing serious gambling problems than are adults.
<P><span class="bodytext">Gambling addiction is a disease, similar to alcohol addiction, in that gamblers often lose control over their behavior and face serious consequences. For many people, gambling problems may increase in severity gradually. Over time,  gambling may:
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Become a way of trying to cope with or escape from life's stressors</li>
	<li>Contribute to impaired judgment and risky behaviors</li>
	<li>Isolate the gambler from others</li>
	<li>Lead to feelings of shame and lowered self-esteem</li>
	<li>Damage or destroy relationships</li>
</ul>

<span class="bodytextsmall"><I>Adapted from Gamblers Anonymous "20 Questions"</I></span>
<BR><BR>
<span class="bodytext">

<P><span class="bodytext">According to the Texas Council on Problem and Compulsive Gambling, "problem gambling" is an early stage of the disease, characterized by personal and relationship problems related to gambling. "Compulsive gambling" is the advanced stage and involves behavior that is out of control.
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>If you answered "yes" to any of these questions, we would encourage you to consider your potential for "problem gambling." </li>
	<li>If you answered "yes" to 3 or more of these questions, you are involved in "problem gambling." </li>
	<li>If you answered "yes" to 7 or more, you may be a compulsive gambler. </li>
</ul>

<H2 class="H2">Alternatives to gambling</H2>
<span class="bodytext">For many people, anxiety, depression, or other emotions can trigger gambling urges. Gambling may seem like an easy or fun way to relieve stress, but there are many alternatives that are not associated with negative consequences. Exercise, deep breathing, and meditation can all be helpful in managing these feelings.  Relaxation exercises are another great way to lessen anxiety. Check out the <A HREF="http://www.cmhc.utexas.edu/stressrecess/index.html" class="a_class_tlink">Stress Recess</A> section of this website for some simple ways to get started on developing these skills.

<a name="friend"></A>
<H2 class="H2">What if a friend has a gambling problem?</H2>
<span class="bodytext">One of the hardest things about helping people with gambling problems is that they are very likely to deny they have any problem even when it's obvious to people around them. "It's no problem for me. I can quit any time I want." "It's not a big deal. I can cover my debts." "When I'm hot, I win back even more than I've lost." "My friends all bet on college football--it's just for fun."
<P><span class="bodytext">If you think a friend has a gambling problem, show your concern. Don't avoid the topic. Do avoid lectures and verbal attacks. Don't continue the conversation if you begin to feel impatient or angry. You may encounter defensiveness and denial. Don't take this personally, but make it clear you're concerned and tell the person how his or her gambling behavior affects you. You may have to set limits with the person. Don't be persuaded into excusing, justifying, overlooking, enabling or participating in the person's self-defeating behaviors. Helping a friend pay a debt may seem to temporarily alleviate the problem, but it can actually perpetuate the problem by contributing to a feeling of invincibility that some gamblers develop.
<P><span class="bodytext">If the person agrees that he or she has a problem, try to:
<ul><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Remain supportive and reinforce even small efforts toward change. </li>
	<li>Be prepared for some steps backward as a normal part of the recovery process. </li>
	<li>Help the person make contact with recovering gamblers and organizations like Gamblers Anonymous. </li>
	<li>Encourage activities that are not related to gambling, and curb your own gambling behaviors. </li>
	<li>Educate yourself about problem and compulsive gambling. </li>
</ul>
