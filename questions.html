                <H2 class="H2">How long is each appointment?</H2>

                <H2 class="H2">Do many students use CMHC?</H2>
                <span class="bodytext">Yes. In fact, it is quite common for students to come for a talk with a counselor. Being in college or graduate school entails many changes and challenges: leaving home, choosing majors, negotiating intimate relationships, and moving on when graduation approaches. It is natural for people to want to talk with someone about these complex developmental issues. And, of course, other students may have additional concerns such as depression, anxiety, eating concerns, self-esteem issues, sexuality, family illnesses, and so on. The CMHC staff is sensitive to the broad range of concerns that students have.
</span></P>
                <H2 class="H2">Is there a charge for your services?</H2>
