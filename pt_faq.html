            <H2 class="H2">Practicum Training Questions and Answers</H2>

            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: Who is qualified for the Integrated Health and General Psychotherapy Practicum tracks at CMHC?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>Practicum Training is open to doctoral students in the Counseling Psychology Training Program and the Clinical Psychology Training Program on the UT-Austin campus.     
</span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: Will I get experience in both group and individual therapy?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>The General Psychotherapy Practicum experience at CMHC is designed to include both individual and group therapy options. Most students who wish to obtain experience in co-leading a group have the opportunity to do so, though the availability of this option depends on a variety of factors (e.g., the number of groups offered that are co-led).   Practicum students in the IH Practicum will gain experience in individual counseling and may have the option to be involved in group interventions as well.  
</span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: How do I apply?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>Applicants must complete the Practicum Application Form, submit a current resume/vita, and provide the names of at least two professors or previous clinical supervisors who may serve as references by the designated deadline in February. After the deadline, all applications will be reviewed by the Practicum Training Director. Qualified students will be contacted to schedule an interview to discuss the applicants' interests and to evaluate the applicants' suitability for the practicum. As indicated, applicants' references and/or departmental representatives may be contacted in order to gather pertinent information.  
 </span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: When do I need to apply for the Psychotherapy Practicum at CMHC?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>The application process begins in late January and closes in mid-February. This year the deadline is February 10, 2014. 
 </span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: What will I gain from this experience?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>Practicum students will build on their skills in individual psychotherapy (and in most cases, group psychotherapy), will be able to learn about and conduct brief and ongoing therapy within a university counseling center, participate as a member of a multidisciplinary staff, and take part in weekly 1:1 supervision meetings and larger seminar sessions. Practicum students will also become familiar with interpersonal process therapy and the overarching "Use of Self" model that is embraced by the CMHC staff as a whole.   In the IH Practicum, students will have the opportunity to work collaboratively with medical professionals and provide individual therapy to UT students who are referred for counseling by medical professionals, in addition to receiving supervision and participating in the practicum seminar every week.  
</span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: How is supervision done at CMHC?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>: Practicum students receive direct supervision for 1.5-2 hours per week regarding their individual clinical work. During the fall semester, all supervision is provided by licensed mental health professionals on the CMHC staff (for General Psychotherapy Practicum students), including psychologists, social workers, and licensed professional counselors. In the spring semester, several practicum students receive supervisory input from both a senior staff psychologist and a pre-doctoral intern working under close supervision.   In the IH Practicum, all students are supervised by licensed mental health professionals who are jointly affiliated with CMHC and the University Health Services.    
</span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext">Supervision of group psychotherapy is done in vivo, as practicum students work with their assigned supervisors (members of the CMHC staff) to lead groups in the Center. In addition to the time spent running the groups, practicum students receive an additional one hour per week of supervision regarding group issues.
</span></P>
            <P><span class="bodytext">Throughout our training programs, the "Use of Self" model is relied on heavily in supervision.
</span></P>
            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: What is the "Use of Self" model?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>Regardless of the specific work activity, a primary "thread" running through all our training activities is the concept of "Use of Self" and its variants. For us, this means assisting the trainee in exploring and understanding the qualities and dynamics that he or she brings to each interpersonal encounter and how these facilitate or hinder effective interactions. It also means that the trainee is encouraged to become more attuned to his or her own thoughts and feelings in working with clients, and recognize how this increased self-awareness can be used to better understand client dynamics and develop effective treatment strategies. Because we believe in the working alliance as an indispensable ingredient in any helping relationship, we encourage trainees to recognize, improve, and employ those personal qualities that will assist in forming effective working relationships with clients, peers, center staff, and other members of the university community.  
</span></P>

            <P><span class="bodytext">Because our training programs are based largely on a relational, use-of-self training model, and because we believe that optimal professional development occurs within the context of self-reflection and personal exploration, our various training activities will, at times, ask trainees to disclose personal information. Our training staff takes very seriously its responsibility to foster and maintain a safe, trusting, and supportive environment that will allow such disclosures to occur in accordance with the goals and objectives of our training model.
</span></P>
            <P><span class="bodytext"><B>Q: What's the structure for the seminar?</B><BR>

<B>A: </B>The seminar meets weekly and typically includes the following elements:
<ul type="disc"><span class="bodytext">
	<li>Formal and informal case presentations and discussion</li>
	<li>Discussion of assigned readings</li>
	<li>Presentations by guest lecturers on a variety of clinically-related topics</li>
	<li>Focused discussions of topics such as crisis intervention, initial consultation training, treatment planning, termination, etc.</li>
